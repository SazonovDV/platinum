To setup wallet "Platinum", open shell and type "sudo Setup-unix.sh". If you

haven't root, type "sudo passwd root", and set any password(DON'T FORGET THAT PASS), and type

"sudo Setup-unix.sh" again.

After that, a shortcut will be created in your home directory. The first time

a shortcut is launched, the system may ask you that you are sure for running

this questionable shortcut. If so, click "Yes." This operation should be done only once,

after that you can safely copy the shortcut to the desktop or leave it as it is.
